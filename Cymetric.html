        <h2>Understanding the Challenge</h2>
        <div class="black-line"></div>
        <img class="right-img" src="images/bank.jpeg">
        <p>Cybersecurity compliance in a global financial organization is a veritable nightmare. (Not an exaggeration.)
        <p> <b>Imagine you are Chief Compliance Officer at Chase bank.</b></p>
        <p>You manage a global cybersecurity program for tens of thousands of employees. You must slay a three-headed compliance dragon:
        </p>
        <p><b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying which regulations to comply with, including current federal and state regulations like <b>HIPPA</b> or <b>NYCRR-500</b>; adding new regulations like <b>GDPR</b> into your compliance roadmap.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing security control implementation and ownership across dozens of information systems and thousands of people. </p>
        <p><b>3.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing gapless records to prove to auditors that the organization is truly compliant with all relevant regulations at all levels.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-width">
        <p> If you do your job improperly, there are dire penalties; for instance, non-compliance with GDPR means <b>your organization may be fined up to &euro;10 million, or 2% annual global turnover &mdash; whichever is higher.</b></p>
        <p>Surprisingly, most of this type of sensitive compliance work is still being done by siloed, ad hoc teams using outdated tools like paper journals and excel spreadsheets. Given my team's expertise in software and our partner firm's deep working relationships with the target customer segment, we decided that this is a billion-dollar problem for which we can design a 10x better solution than what exists in the market today.</p>

            <img class="right-img pull-up" src="images/cymetric-architecture1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>To understand the functionality of Cymetric, let's take a look at the conceptual architecture of the compliance lifecycle:</p>
            <p><b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Regulations at State, Federal, and International Levels. These regulations can be mapped onto a security framework which taxonomizes and details the type of security controls for compliance.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each canonical security control may be applied to information systems, which may be owned by sub-organizations. Each control-information system pairing is known as a "control instance"</p>
            <p><b>3.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auditors would evaluate the compliance at the organization, information system, and control instance levels as one of 5 ratings (ranging from Fully Compliant to Non-Compliant.)</p>

          <div class="black-line"></div>
          <p>Two main persona</p>
          <p><b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance Officer</p>
          <p><b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auditor</p>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <div class="black-line"></div>
        <p>Research insights led us to understand that the most addressable aspects of the problem are:
        * Traceability of each teamâ€™s compliance activities back to a regulation
        * Clear assignment of ownership for each task
        * Single source of truth for the entire organization
        * Allowing auditors to have access to past data in a comprehensive and organized fashion, reduce communication overhead with hundreds of individuals

        Hence we designed a system that is end-to-end, mapping out the relationship between each actor and each step of the compliance process. 1. We designed step-wise navigation menu that follows the lifecycle of compliance activities, starting with managing information and ending with the audit. 2. To reduce cognitive load, we optimized for familiar design patterns over newfangled ones; simple list-detail views. Lastly, we broke out complex processes as workflow-modals and gave the ability to reuse past audits to help auditors manager optimize their workflow.

                <p>Design Constraints
        * Massive number of features and data to work with; complex flows
            * Work-around: reusable components using Angular Material Design to reduce engineering overhead
            * Usage of strong design patterns to help clients familiarize with usage and reduce complexity
            * Get eng input to reduce complexity of engineering, minimizing eng effort rather than most frictionless end user experience (enterprise)
        * Working with a Law Firm with banks we were deeply embedded within the sales cycle and had a lot of restrictions on the way in which we conducted customer interviews. The feedback cycles were short, but most of the feedback came from non-end-users.
            * Work-around: All decisions relating to domain expertise relied on expert feedback from law firm in lieu of end-users from bank;
            * important UX-related decisions were tested with 3 - 5 Caetra internal team members (i.e. design of side nav information architecture)

              <p>
                The first task we set out to do was to map out the different list-detail views that will house the essential data for the compliance management lifecycle. My design process:
                <p><b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brainstorm list of featureset with stakeholders</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card sorting exercise with stakeholders and engineering team</p>
                <p><b>3.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualitative testing and iterate from feedback</p>
              </p>
              <p>This navigation hierarchy was designed to conform to the natural workflow of domain experts. The flat architecture also allows Cymetric users to navigate fluidly between different parts of the compliance management lifecycle and for easy cross-referencing.</p>

            <p>As our research surfaced that compliance officers have a lot of trouble mapping controls onto information systems, one of the key value propositions of the system is to provide automated control instance generation based on inputs. The workflow becomes a simple two-step process:
                <p><b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create information system, adding regulatory objectives</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approve automatically generated pending control instances and publish to organization</p>
