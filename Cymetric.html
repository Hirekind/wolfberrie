            Security
          </h3>
          <p>Security of Coinbase products was communicated through showing how established company Coinbase is in the digital currency space. I also made sure to highlight product features that make Coinbase's security measures exceptional. </p>

            Ease Of Use

          <p>Ease of use was highlighted by listing three easy steps to buying Bitcoin. These instructions were accompanied by appropriate screenshots. The features section mentions the mobile apps and the option for recurring payments, to show the versatility of the product.</p>

            <p>
              On the top of the page it is made clear what the product offers. Originally I also included an option to buy bitcoin straight from the home page. Through AB-testing I discovered that having a simple email field increased the sign up rate more.

            <p>Coinbase is frequently featured in some of the most prominent financial newspapers, so I made sure to include links to these articles. We decided to be very transparent about the company and show some key numbers. The main objective of this section is to increase trust.</p>

            <p>Buying Bitcoin can easily seem like a challenging task. However with Coinbase the process is very easy. This is why I wanted to show the process of purchasing bitcoin accompanied with some product screenshots. The feature list highlights how secure and versatile Coinbase brokerage is. </p>

            <p>The carousel on the bottom of the page shows the user what other products Coinbase has. This section is dedicated to the three groups that are would not be the main user group for  the Coinbase brokerage: developers, merchants and traders.</p>

        <h2>AB Testing</h2>
        <div class="black-line"></div>
        <p>
        We AB tested multiple versions of the hero section of the home page to see which one would most increase the signup rates and the percentage of first buys. </p>

      <div class="ab-case-container">
        <div class="ab-case">

           <p>This was the first version we tried. The idea was that the user would be able to buy bitcoin straight from the home page. </p>

        <div class="ab-case">
          <img src="images/ab-2.png">
          <p>
          Ultimately this version was deemed better. Switching the buy box to a simple email field increased the amount of signups as well as the amount of users that would complete their first purchase.</p>
