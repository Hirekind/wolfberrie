           If you wanted to send a message to an Ethereum address, how would you do it? ETHMessenger was built after 6 months of research by Ethereum Foundation Advisors to address that gap. However, after the functionality was built, it wasn't clear what were the use cases or the target users were for this exciting technology. I was brought on to help find product market fit and redesign the app for its new use cases.

        <img class="right-img pull-up75" src="images/eth-before.jpg">
        <p>When I came onto the project, the app already had an existing architecture but no clear users. The founders had interviewed numerous parties to ask about potential use cases and came back with many fragmented, long-tail answers.</p>
        <p>Thus, I implemented a rigorous screening rubric for the ideal end user / early adoptor customer segment to discover the persona(s) who would use this app at high volume. I also helped clarify who are the ideal partners through which the team can develop channels to large pools of the end user.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            As it was unclear who would need to use this messaging app at high volume, we decided to list all possible segments and evaluate them according to an "early adopter rubric". Narrowing our list down to 2 high-potential persona, we then conducted 20 customer discovery interviews at the ETHDenver conference. We eliminated the community organizer as a persona, since they are happy with current tools and don't seem to have a highly painful problem. However, in the process we discovered that traders specializing in NFT (Non-fungible token) trades currently have no way of reaching out to a stranger to initiate a potential trade.

            A chat app with a use case
          </h3>
          <p>I helped the ETHMessenger team prototype custom solutions for 5 platforms, gaining their first 3 partnerships, including Dapper (Cryptokitties). The thesis was that these platforms would want to engage the end user, so we changed the design from a full-screen messaging app to something that remains in the context of the native application. This addresses both the engagement concern from the platform point of view as well as the reach out problem from the end-user point of view. We thus discovered a great early adopter segment for this app which previously had no true use case. You can play with the desktop and mobile prototypes below.</p>

          <p>This prototype was produced to introduce the idea of an in-game chat for Dapper, the producer of Cryptokitties. The features we wanted to highlight were to showcase the benefits to the dApp developer, mainly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facilitation with user-to-user trades</li>
            <li>In-game user engagement through promoted group chats</li>

          <div class="black-line"></div>
          <p>I also produced a mobile experience to demonstrate the same functionality could be portable, as 83% of Cryptokitties users demonstrate cross-platform usage.</p>
          <p>The advantage of being a mobile experience is that users are much more willing to engage with chat here, versus on desktop. The idea is that once a user has an impression of ETHMessenger in the context of the partner brand, they would continue the engagement with both ETHMessenger and the partner brand in the chat. The chat then acts as a channel to pull users back into  engaging with Cryptokitties.</p>
