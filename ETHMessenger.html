  	  		<p>
           If you wanted to send a message to an Ethereum address, how would you do it? ETHMessenger was built after 6 months of research by Ethereum Foundation Advisors to address that gap. However, after the functionality was built, it wasn't clear what were the use cases or the target users were for this exciting technology. I was brought on to help find product market fit and redesign the app for its new use cases.

          </h3>
          <p>
          	As it was unclear who would need to use this messaging app at high volume, we decided to list all possible segments and evaluate them according to an "early adopter rubric". Narrowing our list down to 2 high-potential persona, we then conducted 20 customer discovery interviews at the ETHDenver conference. We eliminated the community organizer as a persona, since they are happy with current tools and don't seem to have a highly painful problem. However, in the process we discovered that traders specializing in NFT (Non-fungible token) trades currently have no way of reaching out to a stranger to initiate a potential trade.

            A chat app with a use case
          </h3>
          <p>I helped the ETHMessenger team prototype custom solutions for 5 platforms, gaining their first 3 partnerships, including Dapper (Cryptokitties). The thesis was that these platforms would want to engage the end user, so we changed the design from a full-screen messaging app to something that remains in the context of the native application. This addresses both the engagement concern from the platform point of view as well as the reach out problem from the end-user point of view. We thus discovered a great early adopter segment for this app which previously had no true use case. You can play with the desktop and mobile prototypes below.</p>
